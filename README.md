FontSwap
========

Quickly switch between two different font settings in Sublime Text 2 / 3.

## Scenario

[Source Code Pro](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sourcecodepro.adobe/files/) is a nice new legible typeface for coding. I'd prefer to use it all the time. Problem is, it doesn't look great on all monitors, particularly low-end Dells. But it _does_ look great on a MBP retina display. So when I'm using the Dell monitor I'm using [Inconsolata-g](http://leonardo-m.livejournal.com/77079.html) and when I'm not using an extra monitor I'm using Source Code Pro.

## Installation

`git clone` into Sublime's `Packages` directory.

## Configuration

Fire open the Default FontSwap sublime-settings file and also open the User FontSwap sublime-settings file. Paste the Default settings into the User settings and tweak to taste. `font_a` should match the default `font*` settings in your Preferences.sublime-settings file.

## Usage

The default keyboard trigger is `super+shift+f4`. Modify the sublime-keymap file for your platform to taste. You can also invoke the FontSwap command from Sublime's command palette.
